    "\n",
    "In this workshop, you will work with real-world data from the **EXIOBASE Input-Output Database**. By leveraging Input-Output (IO) analysis, you will explore the economic interconnections between industries and their environmental impacts. Through practical examples, you will learn how to calculate the **Leontief Inverse** and use it to assess how changes in final demand influence internal demand. Additionally, the workshop will guide you through visualizaing **demand impacts & shocks**, providing insight into how industries interact with ecological resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Learning objectives**\n",
    "- **Download and manage Input-Output (IO) data** from EXIOBASE.\n",
    "- **Calculate the Leontief Inverse**, which is central to analyzing the relationships between economic sectors.\n",
    "- **Understand the impact of changes in final demand** on production across various industries.\n",
    "- **Develop practical skills** in handling real-world datasets, applying input-output models, and generating meaningful insights for operational risk and environmental sustainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resources\n",
    "- 🔗 [EXIOBASE](https://www.exiobase.eu/): A global, detailed *Multi-Regional Environmentally Extended Supply-Use Table (MR-SUT) and Input-Output Table (MR-IOT)* developed to estimate emissions and resource extractions by industry across numerous countries.\n",

    "\n",
    "The **EXIOBASE** database provides detailed **Input-Output Tables (MR-IOTs)**, thus, covering a wide range of industries and countries. It captures both **economic transactions** and **environmental data**, which include emissions and resource extraction by industry. The database is structured to represent inter-industry transactions, with rows corresponding to industries and columns representing the inputs they receive from others.\n",
    "\n",
    "EXIOBASE is valuable for multi-regional analysis and allows users to study the environmental and economic impact of industries across regions. It provides a detailed breakdown of **monetary flows** between industries, as well as **environmental extensions** such as energy use and emissions data. Subsequently, these attributes make it ideal for sustainability assessments, economic impact studies, and  understanding global resource consumption patterns.\n",

    "\n",
    "> **Countries/regions**: EXIOBASE includes multi-regional data, with each sector represented for different countries. In the matrices, country codes (e.g., `AT` for Austria, `BE` for Belgium) indicate which nation the data pertains to. This allows for cross-country comparisons and the aggregation of data by region or global totals.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Products**: The dataset provides detailed data on specific products produced or consumed within each sector, enabling product-level analysis within the IO framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Environmental extensions**: While not directly visible in the technical matrices we are loading, environmental extensions detail industry-specific environmental impacts, such as energy consumption, emissions, and resource extraction. These are typically available in satellite tables, which provide additional layers of ecological and resource usage data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Extensions in `EXIOBASE`  link the sectors to environmental impacts - e.g., greenhouse gas emissions, water use, and material flows, enabling researchers to evaluate sustainability and resource efficiency. Regular updates ensure alignment with evolving research needs."

It models the flow of goods and services, offering insights into how industries rely on one another for inputs and contribute to final demand.\n",

    "As Blair and Miller (2009) explain, *\"the Leontief model assumes fixed technical coefficients, allowing us to track how a unit increase in final demand for a product affects total output across all sectors\"* (p. 46). This core concept captures the direct and indirect effects of changes in final demand across all sectors.\n",

    "In this section, we will simulate a **demand shock** by adjusting the final demand vector. We will focus on specific sectors, **increasing demand** for `gas (sector 22)` and **decreasing demand** for `coal (sector 20)`, to simulate potential reactions to changes in energy policy or crises, such as a gas shortage. The analysis will illustrate how a shift in final demand impacts total output across sectors, using the ***Leontief Inverse*** matrix to capture these effects.\n",

    "#### Step 1: Simulating a demand shock `(↑ gas, ↓ coal)`\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate a demand shock, we adjust the `x` vector by modifying the demand for specific sectors - increasing demand for gas (sector 22) and decreasing demand for coal (sector 20). This setup allows us to explore how shifts in demand for these energy sources affect the economy, and we will also reverse the adjustments to simulate the opposite scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sector indices**: We first identify the indices for the targeted sectors (gas and coal) within the dataset.\n",
    "2. **Shock values**: We then determine the magnitude of the demand change for each sector, specifying an increase for gas and a decrease for coal.\n",
    "3. **Demand shock vector**: We initialize a demand shock vector filled with zeros to match the dimensions of the final demand matrix. The shock values are then assigned to the relevant indices, effectively simulating a targeted increase or decrease in demand for each sector."

    "#### Discussion: Potential insights related to energy footprint analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "While not covered in the scope of this workshop, incorporating energy footprint calculations into the Input-Output (IO) framework could offer valuable insights into sustainability and resource efficiency. Here are some potential insights that an energy footprint analysis might reveal:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Energy intensity**: By analyzing energy usage across sectors, we could identify which sectors are the most energy-intensive. These sectors often exhibit large multiplier effects, meaning they require substantial amounts of energy - both directly and indirectly - to meet final demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Sectoral interdependencies**: Integrating the Leontief inverse with energy-related data would expose the interdependencies among sectors. Certain industries may rely heavily on energy-intensive sectors as input suppliers, leading to a higher aggregate energy footprint across the production chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Energy mix**: Visualizing the breakdown of energy types (e.g., electricity, gas, coal) consumed by each sector could provide insights into the composition of energy sources used within industries. This breakdown would help highlight which sectors are more dependent on fossil fuels versus renewable energy, guiding energy transition strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Target sectors for sustainability**: By identifying sectors with high energy intensity or reliance on non-renewable sources, this analysis could inform sustainability strategies. Key sectors for intervention could be highlighted, where improvements in energy efficiency or shifts to cleaner energy sources would yield the most significant environmental benefits."

    "**Input-Output (IO) analysis** is an economic model that tracks the flow of goods and services between industries, widely applied in **operational risk modeling** and **environmental analysis** to understand economic and ecological interdependencies across sectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "A key tool in this framework is **`EXIOBASE`**, a global multi-regional Input-Output table that provides comprehensive data for analyzing interactions among industries and countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **Leontief Inverse** further enhances this analysis by showing how changes in the final demand of one sector propagate across the entire economy, affecting internal demand across multiple sectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, studying **demand shocks and ecological impacts** within the Input-Output framework allows us to assess how economic demand shifts influence environmental factors, such as energy consumption and emissions. By linking demand changes to ecological footprints, we gain valuable insights into sustainability, highlighting sectors where efforts to mitigate environmental impacts could be most effective.\n",
